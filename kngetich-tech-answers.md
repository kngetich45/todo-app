# Technical questions 
 

 1. How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

    - I dedicated a day and a half to the coding test. Given more time, I would have implemented an edit feature and more unit tests

 
 2. Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?

    - Dragging and dropping to reorder items across all the filters but was not difficult.
    - During deployment, I encountered an issue where GitHub was unable to build the SVG file format, posing a challenge.
